## ⚙️ Setup Tutorial (Gen Z friendly version 😎)

### 🧩 Step 1: Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/k1itllx1killx/ST-FIND.git
cd ST-FIND
```
💽 Step 2: Run setup wizard

This installs all dependencies (lolcat, requests, termcolor, etc.)
```
python3 setup.py
```
> 👀 Hit Y when asked — it’ll auto install 15+ required packages with pip/pkg!




---

🔥 Step 3: Start the scanner
```
python3 st-find.py
```
✨ Step 4: Enter your username

Example:
```
Enter the username to check (no @): .satanae
```
Then it’ll automatically scan TikTok, Instagram, YouTube, Steam, Twitch, Discord, and more ⚡
and show you whether the username is taken ❌ or available ✅.

💡 Example Output

[21:30:44] [INFO] [=] Starting scan for "satanae" across 100 networks...
[21:30:45] [INFO] [+] Name available "satanae (GitHub)"
[21:30:46] [INFO] [-] Name taken "satanae (Instagram)"

🧰 Requirements

🐍 Python 3.8+

💻 Internet connection

Optional: lolcat, figlet for colored banners


If you’re on Termux, everything installs automatically with:

pkg install python git -y


---

🧠 How It Works

The script loops through a list of 100+ social networks.

For each one, it tries to access your username’s profile URL.

If it returns a 404, it’s available ✅
If it returns a 200, it’s taken ❌

It handles redirects, errors, and rate limits gracefully.
